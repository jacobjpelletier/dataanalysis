Udacity's Intro To Programming Nano-degree

Assignment:
"Evaluation
Use the Project Rubric to review your project. If you are happy with your submission, then you are ready to submit! If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, keep working!

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to the same Project Rubric. Your project must "meet specifications" in each category in order for your submission to pass.

Submission
What to include in your submission
A PDF or HTML file containing your analysis. This file should include:
A note specifying which dataset you analyzed
A statement of the question(s) you posed
A description of what you did to investigate those questions
Documentation of any data wrangling you did
Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results
If the code you used to perform your analysis is not included in the above, you should submit the code separately in .py file(s).
A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources).
Jupyter notebook instructions
If you used Jupyter notebook to create your analysis, you can include your code directly in the notebook and do not need to submit it separately. To download your notebook as an HTML file, click on File -> Download.As -> HTML (.html) within the notebook. If you get an error about "No module name", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using pip install <module_name> (don't include the "<" or ">" or any words following a period in the module name).
